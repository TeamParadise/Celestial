# Celestial
This repository contains the code for Team Paradise's second offseason robot, 1165B, "Celestial".

This code has the following features:
  - Nearly full AdvantageKit implementation (replay not added for shooter or intake yet).
  - PathPlanner support (still being worked on, hopefully after the drivetrain rebuild it will be fully implemented).
  - Encoder-based Shoot and Amp commands, which shoot as soon as the flywheels are within a specific speed.
